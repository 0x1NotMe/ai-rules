# Struct & Slot Packing

<version>1.0.0</version>

## Context
- Multiple state variables smaller than 256 bits (e.g. bool, uint8, address)
- Data stored contiguously in storage

## Requirements
- MUST group small types to fit into a single 256-bit slot
- SHOULD use structs for related fields to improve readability

## Examples
<example>
// ✅ Good: packing bool and uint8 together
struct UserData {
  bool isActive;
  uint8 level;
  uint240 padding;
}
</example>

<example type="invalid">
// ❌ Bad: single-slot types spread across multiple variables
bool isActive;
uint8 level;
uint240 padding;
</example>
